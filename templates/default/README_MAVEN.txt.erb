If maven does not work and this is the first time that you have ever fired up the VM, 
you will need to shut down the vm and start it again, such as from the VirtualBox UI

This will fire /etc/profile.d/mavenInit.sh which initializes M2_HOME and PATH variables

From this point forward, it should work every time you restart the VM
